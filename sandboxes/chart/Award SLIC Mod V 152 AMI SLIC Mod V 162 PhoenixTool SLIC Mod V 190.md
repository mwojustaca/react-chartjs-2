If you want to activate Windows 7 on your computer without buying a license key, you might be interested in using SLIC mods. SLIC stands for Software Licensing Description Table, which is a part of the BIOS that contains information about the OEM license and activation. By modifying the SLIC table in your BIOS, you can trick Windows 7 into thinking that your computer is from a specific manufacturer and has a valid license.
