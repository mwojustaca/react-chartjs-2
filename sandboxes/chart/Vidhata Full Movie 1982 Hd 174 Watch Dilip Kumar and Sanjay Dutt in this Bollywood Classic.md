The film begins with Shamsher Singh (Dilip Kumar), a wealthy and powerful landlord who rules over his village with an iron fist. He has a son, Pratap Singh (Suresh Oberoi), who is an honest and upright police officer. Pratap is married to Durga (Padmini Kolhapure), a simple and loving girl who is pregnant with their child.
 
One day, Pratap arrests a notorious smuggler named David (Tom Alter) and his gang, who are working for Sir Mizia (Shreeram Lagoo), a corrupt businessman and politician. Sir Mizia orders David to kill Pratap and his family. David succeeds in killing Pratap, but fails to kill Durga and her newborn son, Kunal.
 
Durga escapes with Kunal and takes shelter in a slum, where she meets Abu Baba (Sanjeev Kumar), a kind-hearted and generous man who runs an orphanage. Abu Baba adopts Kunal as his own son and raises him with love and care. Kunal grows up to be a brave and loyal young man (Sanjay Dutt), who considers Abu Baba as his father.
 
Meanwhile, Shamsher Singh is devastated by the loss of his son and vows to take revenge on Sir Mizia and David. He hires a gang of thugs led by Bheema (Birbal) to kill them. However, he does not know that Bheema is actually working for Sir Mizia and is planning to betray him.
 
The film reaches its climax when Kunal decides to avenge Abu Baba's death, who is killed by David on Sir Mizia's orders. He discovers his grandfather's true identity and the reason behind his father's death. He joins forces with Shamsher Singh to fight against Sir Mizia and David. The film ends with Kunal killing David and Shamsher Singh killing Sir Mizia, thus fulfilling their revenge.
