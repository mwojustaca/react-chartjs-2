One of the most exciting features of Going Medieval is the custom difficulty option, which allows you to modify various aspects of the game according to your preferences. You can adjust the frequency and intensity of events, such as thunderstorms, raids, and diseases, as well as the global values and multipliers that affect your colony's productivity, happiness, and survival. For example, you can turn off thunderstorms completely if you find them annoying, or you can increase the global work speed if you want to see your colonists work harder. You can also tweak the Barter Value setting to get more favorable trade deals with other factions. In short, you have the freedom to add or remove as much micromanagement as you want, which is great for creating your own unique and personalized Going Medieval experience.
  
Another way to customize your game is by choosing from different scenarios that have different starting conditions and challenges. You can start with a basic scenario that gives you three colonists, some basic resources, and a peaceful environment, or you can try a more advanced scenario that puts you in a harsher climate, with more enemies, and fewer supplies. You can also create your own scenarios by using the scenario editor, which lets you set the number of colonists, their traits and skills, the map size and biome, the starting season and year, and the difficulty level.

Once you have chosen your scenario, you can start building your medieval colony from scratch. You will need to gather resources, such as wood, stone, clay, and metal, and use them to construct buildings, furniture, tools, and weapons. You will also need to grow crops and hunt animals for food, and craft clothing and medicine for your colonists. You will have to balance the needs and wants of your colonists, who have their own personalities, opinions, and relationships. You will also have to deal with external threats, such as bandits, wild animals, and natural disasters.
