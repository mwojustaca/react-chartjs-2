## Logical Acquisition
 
Logical acquisition is the simplest and fastest method of data extraction. It can be performed on any iOS device running any version of iOS, as long as the device is unlocked or can be unlocked with a passcode or biometric authentication. Logical acquisition extracts a standard iTunes backup of the device, along with some additional data such as media files, crash logs, and shared files. Logical acquisition does not require a jailbreak or any modifications to the device.
 
To perform logical acquisition, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Elcomsoft Ios Forensic Toolkit on your computer.
2. Select "Logical Acquisition" from the main menu.
3. Connect the iOS device to the computer with a USB cable.
4. If prompted, enter the passcode or use biometric authentication to unlock the device.
5. If prompted, tap "Trust" on the device to allow access from the computer.
6. Wait for the software to detect the device and display its information.
7. Select the data types you want to extract from the device. You can choose from backup, media files, crash logs, and shared files.
8. Click "Start" to begin the extraction process.
9. Wait for the extraction to complete. The progress and status will be displayed on the screen.
10. The extracted data will be saved in a folder on your computer. You can view and analyze the data with Elcomsoft Phone Viewer or other forensic tools.
