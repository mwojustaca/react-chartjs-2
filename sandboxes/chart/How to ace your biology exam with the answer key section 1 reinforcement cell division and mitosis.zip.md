## What is Cell Division and Mitosis?
`  `
Cell division is the process by which a cell splits into two or more daughter cells. This is essential for growth, development, repair, and reproduction of living organisms. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.
`  `
Mitosis is the type of cell division that produces two identical daughter cells from one parent cell. Each daughter cell has the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, which are all the cells in the body except for sex cells.
`  `
The process of mitosis can be divided into four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, the chromosomes condense and become visible, the nuclear membrane breaks down, and the spindle fibers form. In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the equator of the cell. In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. In telophase, the chromosomes decondense, the nuclear membrane reforms, and the cytoplasm divides.

## Answer Key for Section 1 Reinforcement Cell Division and Mitosis
`  `
Now that you have a basic understanding of what cell division and mitosis are, let's review the answer key for section 1 reinforcement cell division and mitosis. Here are the correct answers to each question:
`  `
`
`1. Many-celled organisms grow because **cell division increases the total number of cells in the organism**.
`
`2. The life cycle of an organism begins with its **formation**.
`
`3. A series of events that take place from one cell division to the next is called a **cell cycle**.
`
`4. The time for a cell cycle differs depending on **the type of cell**.
`
`5. New cells are needed for **growth, development, repair, and reproduction**.
`
`6. A eukaryotic cell spends most of its life in **interphase**.
`
`7. The process in which the nucleus divides to form two identical nuclei is called **mitosis**.
`
`8. A structure in the nucleus that contains hereditary material is called a **chromosome**.
`
`9. A chromosome is made of two identical **sister chromatids**.
`
`10. A complex molecule containing genetic information that makes up chromosomes is called **DNA**.
`
`11. A part of the cell containing DNA and responsible for growth and reproduction is called a **nucleus**.
`
`12. Sister chromatids are held together by a **centromere**.
`
`13. An organism or cell having two sets of chromosomes or twice the haploid number is called **diploid**.
`
`14. Sex cells that contain only half the number of chromosomes are called **haploid**.
`
`15. The period of the cell cycle between cell divisions is called **interphase**.
`
`16. The four stages of mitosis are **prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase**.
