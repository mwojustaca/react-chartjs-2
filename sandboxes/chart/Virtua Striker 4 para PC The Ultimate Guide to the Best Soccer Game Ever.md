If you want to play Virtua Striker 4 on your PC, you will need an emulator that can run arcade games based on the Triforce hardware, which is a collaboration between Sega, Nintendo, and Namco. One of the most popular emulators for this purpose is Dolphin, which can also run GameCube and Wii games.
 
To play Virtua Striker 4 on Dolphin, you will need to download the game ROM from a reliable source and extract it to a folder on your PC. Then, you will need to configure Dolphin's settings to match the game's requirements. For example, you will need to enable dual-core mode, set the video backend to OpenGL or Vulkan, and adjust the controller settings to your preference.
 
Once you have everything set up, you can launch Dolphin and select Virtua Striker 4 from the game list. You should be able to enjoy the arcade soccer action on your PC with high-quality graphics and sound. However, keep in mind that emulation is not perfect and you may encounter some glitches or errors along the way.
 
Virtua Striker 4 is a fun and fast-paced soccer game that can bring back some nostalgia for arcade fans. If you want to try it out on your PC, you can follow these steps and use Dolphin as your emulator of choice. However, please note that downloading ROMs of games that you do not own is illegal and may violate copyright laws.

Virtua Striker 4 is not the only arcade game that you can play on your PC with Dolphin. There are many other games that use the Triforce hardware, such as Mario Kart Arcade GP, F-Zero AX, and The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. You can download these ROMs from the same source as Virtua Striker 4 and configure Dolphin accordingly.
 
Another option to play arcade games on your PC is to use MAME, which stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. MAME can run thousands of arcade games from various eras and platforms, including Sega, Nintendo, Atari, Capcom, and more. However, MAME can be more complicated to set up and use than Dolphin, and it may not run some games as smoothly or accurately.
